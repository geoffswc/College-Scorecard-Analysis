    "This workbook uses the DOE dataset to investigate claims from a WSJ article around indebtedness levels for masters degree recipients at elite schools. The article singles out film, art, and certain health programs as areas where students are going deeply into debt for degrees that don't pay very well.\n",

A masters degree in computer science or engineering from a highly ranked public university does appear to be a pretty favorable option, at least from an income and debt perspective. Though now that I look at it... private colleges seem to offer a CS masters for considerably less than other degrees. Stanford has very low debt, and while Columbia CS masters may not produce quite as high a salary with such low debt as UC San Diego or Berkeley, it still looks like a favorable ROI. \n",
